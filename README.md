# Simple-Portfolio-v1
A simple portofolio page that highlights my skills, qualifications and experience. I built the website using basic HTML, CSS and Javscript to mainly practice
and solidify my CSS skills at a fundamental level. The process albeit frustrating at times, especially responsively aligning items, helped instill a new appreciation
for the language. 

The website is hosted on github webpages over here: https://brucefernandes.github.io/Simple-Portfolio-v1/

# Concepts learned
- Understanding basic CSS concepts like margins, padding, positions & typography
- The importance of media queries to create responsive designs and their limitations
- Manipulating Flexbox to help organise data on a page responsively 

# Next Steps
I intend to replicate this website using React (my go to frontend framework) and Material UI since this site is a single page application by default
and to improve the styling and responsiveness by following Google's material design concepts.
